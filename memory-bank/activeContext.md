# Active Context

## Current Status
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-01
**Current Focus**: Initial project setup and documentation

## Recent Activities
- ✅ Created comprehensive CLAUDE.md file for the entire repository
- ✅ Analyzed codebase structure and architecture
- ✅ Identified main components: Backend, Core, and UI
- ✅ Documented build processes and development workflows
- ✅ Created memory-bank folder structure

## Current Work
**Setting up memory-bank system**:
- Creating external brain documentation structure
- Documenting project context and patterns
- Establishing tracking systems for progress and context

## Next Steps (Immediate)
1. **Complete memory-bank initialization**:
   - Fill in progress.md with current project status
   - Review and refine all memory-bank files

2. **Explore development environment**:
   - Set up local development environment
   - Test build processes
   - Verify database setup requirements

3. **Architecture deep dive**:
   - Analyze key service implementations
   - Understand gRPC communication patterns
   - Review security implementations

## Blocked Items
- None identified at this time

## Questions for Investigation
- What is the current development status of the project?
- Are there any known issues or bugs that need immediate attention?
- What are the immediate development priorities?
- Is there existing documentation about deployment procedures?
- What is the testing strategy and coverage?

## Notes
- Project appears to be mature with comprehensive build system
- Documentation exists but needs consolidation
- Multi-protocol support is well-architected
- Security measures are properly implemented
