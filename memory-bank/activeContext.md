   - Test compiled binaries functionality
   - Validate inter-component communication
   - Performance testing and optimization

2. **Deployment automation**:
   - Create deployment scripts
   - Containerization (Docker)
   - Infrastructure as Code

3. **Knowledge transfer and documentation**:
   - Create user manuals
   - Developer guides
   - Best practices documentation

## Blocked Items

## Questions for Investigation
- What is the current development status of the project?
- Are there any known issues or bugs that need immediate attention?
- What are the immediate development priorities?
- Is there existing documentation about deployment procedures?
- What is the testing strategy and coverage?

## Notes
- Project appears to be mature with comprehensive build system
- Documentation exists but needs consolidation
- Multi-protocol support is well-architected
- Security measures are properly implemented
